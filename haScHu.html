<LI>DRIVE SAFELY!
</LI><LI>You will be given a list of things to find or tasks to complete. A Facebook group chat will be created for the event, and each team will submit photo or video evidence of finding an item or completion of a task to this group chat in real time.
</LI><LI>If your team has more than 1 member, please decide which member will be responsible for submitting materials to the event chat before the scavenger hunt starts.  Submissions will only be accepted from one member of each team.
</LI><LI>For items marked [VIDEO], please submit a short video immediately followed by the item number.  For all other items, submit a single photo immediately followed by the item number.  For example, if you found item 1, a black cat, you will submit a photo of the black cat, then “1”, into the event group chat.
</LI><LI>The judges will react to each submission with thumbs-up or thumbs-down to indicate whether it has been accepted or rejected.
</LI><LI>To avoid confusion with the acceptance/rejection process, please do NOT react to any submissions with FB emojis (i.e., no thumbs-up, thumbs-down, smileys or hearts) during the scavenger hunt.  At the end of the hunt, you will be asked to vote on your favourite/funniest video submission using the smiley emoji reaction.  Please feel free to comment (trash talk) on others&rsquo; submissions using text.</LI>
